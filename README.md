# Pulse & Planets Data Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes heart rate data collected by a gym in partnership with an elementary school, and explores exoplanet data. The goal is to create informative and visually appealing visualizations that demonstrate relationships between diet, exercise, and heart rate, as well as key patterns in exoplanet discoveries.

## Features
- **Pulse Data Analysis**: Heatmaps and categorical plots showing how diet and exercise types affect heart rate
- **Planets Data Analysis**: 6 different visualizations covering relational, distributional, and categorical plots
- **Elementary-Friendly Explanations**: Kid-appropriate explanations of heart rate findings
- **Scientific Insights**: Analysis of exoplanet discovery methods and trends

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

## Usage
Run the main script to generate all visualizations:
```python
python pulse_data_visualization.py
